# IN PROGRESS
## Chart Framework

This is a basic framework using Node to create a web page full of graphs. The page is able to be dynamically altered 
(add more charts, modify colors, windows, etc.). All that is required is to put your dataset into the different charts.
 
## Getting started
1. Clone or download the repository
2. run `npm install` in the base of the repository
3. run `npm start` to start the basic demo
4. Point your browser to `localhost:3000` to view the demo

# TODO
* chart options
* add in dynamic chart generation
* add in header/favicon
* smoother animations for high frequency data
